        <p class="Text">
          In creative programming I got to work with my first real programming
          language, this is the definition of a course that fits me well, as it
          is so close to my professional identity. The course gave you new
          surface level components to code with every week and then let you
          explore what else you could do with the things you got. The course
          worked really well with my eagerness to learn and challenge myself and
          allowed me to put a lot of hours in without losing motivation, as the
          final deliverable let me do whatever I wanted to make, as long as you
          could influence the thing you made with something in the real world.
          The course let me work a lot in technology and realization, as it
          allowed me to make interactive prototypes, I also worked on some
          creativity and aesthetics, because I put thought into colour pallets
          and interactions. Lastly, I also worked on my professional skills, on
          communication and teaching in a way, as I helpen a couple of people
          with their code, explaining how x worked, or why their code did not
          work. The real question is why this course went so well, and if I
          could perhaps take elements that worked well to other courses. I think
          it was mostly the subject, but it was also the way in which we were
          allowed to learn, they allowed us to go on tangents, something I often
          do to learn.
